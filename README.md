# Coursework: deeplearning.ai
I started getting interested in learning deeplearning and I thought this course would be a great place to start. 

This repo contains all the answers to assignments in that course 

This course took me 4 months to complete for the first 3 courses and is highly recommended for anyone with a python background and interested in introductory course into AI/Deep Learning. 

I particularly liked the attention to theory and mathematics paired with intuition 

Also, I tried to count the number of times Andrew Ng said 'concretely' in this course.... I came up ~89 times .... :)
